"""gosh: use Golang as a shell scripting language.

This is written in Python so that I don't have to commit any binaries to my
dotfiles repo, and my Go shell scripts can also remain in source form.

Usage: write a Go program with this shebang comment on top immediately before
the `package main` statement:

    #!/usr/bin/env gosh
    package main

And make it executable and run it like any shell script.
